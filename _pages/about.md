I am a final year undergraduate student from [Division of Social Science](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk), [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk), majoring Quantitative Social Analysis. My research interest includes political science and quantitative history. I am currently exploring how religious architecture engage in community governance in landlocked China.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. David ZWEIG](https://www.drdavidzweig.com/about-dz/) from Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. I was advised by [Prof. David HENDRY](https://sosc.hkust.edu.hk/people/david-hendry) from Division of Social Science, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.
